St Peter: 
Welcome my 
friend. 
You are probably
wondering what
you are doing here.
Well, you just died.

You: 
WHAT? Are you kidding me?

St Peter: 
Sorry bro. 
Anyway, I haven't decided 
to send you to hell or heaven yet. 
So I have a few missions for you! 
If you want to end up in heaven, 
it's important to be unselfish, 
kind and clever. Do you understand?

You:
Yeah, whatever.

St Peter 
Great. Well I have to get to a meeting, 
I'll send you right to your first mission! 
6
Ehm, I must say I'm not impressed so far. Ready for your next mission?

Wow, I totally didn't expect that! Are you ready for your next mission?
